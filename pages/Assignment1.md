##### Name your blog
Come up with a name and description for your blog.  Edit the file `/blog-kit/targets/cb/_config.yml`.  Update the title, email, description, author and url feilds.  Then kill your local server (if it's running) and restart it to see your changes.  The server will automatically update when you edit pages.  All you will need to do is refresh your page to see your changes.  However, when you edit the `_config.yml` file you will need to restart the server.

##### Make your first post
Create a new file in the `_posts` directory.  Name it with the same naming convention as the posts that are in there.  Use today's date and the post's title (it should be about rock climbing).  Copy the contents of 'ABriefTourOfSmartdown' into your new post.  Delete the content but keep the header which you can edit. Make sure to add rockclimbing as a tag.  Write a post about rockclimbing.  Add a video of you rockclimbing.  On the Notes page there's a resource section that has a smartdown help page.  Use that to figure out how to add the video.  Upload the video to your youtube page first.  

##### Delete the old posts
Your post should show up from your home page.   If it doesn't come find me for trouble shooting.  Once your page looks good, delete the other posts that are dummy posts.  

##### Collect Photos
Collect photos that you want to use for headers.  You need a picture for your home page, your About page, and headers for you posts.
