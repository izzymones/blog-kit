### About Me

My name is Isidore Mones.


### About My Site

 This site is a Jekyll blog that is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It allows me to write in [smartdown](https://smartdown.site/#gallery/Home.md) which is an extension of Markdown that makes it easy to write interactive explorable explanations. My blog is a place to explore topics that interest me. My first posts are interactive simulations of space objects to get used to programming in this system. Currently Iâ€™m working on a larger project for my blog that takes data from the James Webb Space Telescope and processes it so I can display it in a web browser and allow a user to shift the image from infrared to the visual spectrum however they want. It allows the user to create their own unique and beautiful picture of the Phantom Galaxy or the Cosmic Cliffs.
