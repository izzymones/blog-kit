Installation notes:

I needed to install brew, ruby, fswatch and some dependencies.  Found the jekyll install page helpful.

https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/

had some issues with ruby versions.  currently using 3.1.2 but had to go into the cb directory and run

bundle add webrick

its a bundle that is no longer automatically included.
