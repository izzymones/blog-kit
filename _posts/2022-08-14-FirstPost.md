### Bouldering
![fullwidth](https://youtu.be/7hS-McBaifs)
One of my extracurricular activities is rock climbing. I have been climbing around 6-10 hours a week for four years and I absolutely adore it. I mostly climb at my local gym, but I will occasionally climb outside. There are a few different kinds of climbing, but I do bouldering, which is at most fifteen feet off the ground and doesn’t use equipment. Bouldering combines athletic performance with intense problem solving. Climbing the most difficult routes requires more than just strength. I take my training pretty seriously, and I have a strength and conditioning training plan, however, strength isn’t what allows you to climb the hardest routes. At its highest level, climbing involves being aware of the physics of a problem. Small changes in where you place your center of gravity, the shape of your body, or how you control your momentum can make a small hand hold workable or lead to a fall. It requires planning and precision. Some people find this kind of climbing tedious or boring, but I never get tired of it.  It requires patience but the thrill you get when you figure out the solution is addicting.  I’ve never been interested in competitive climbing, but I’m proud to be one of the best climbers at my gym climbing at the highest grade. I regularly complete V9 and V10 level climbs which is at the border between advanced and professional levels. Another thing I love about rock climbing is the extremely collaborative aspect of it. Everyone is very supportive of one another and they work together to solve difficult routes. When multiple strong climbers work together to find a working strategy there isn't much that can stop them from making it to the top.


For me rock climbing is like breathing. I have to do it to feel alive. Outside of school it is what I’m most passionate about and if I can’t climb for a week because of gym closures or traveling I find it difficult. I use it to manage difficult feelings, reduce stress, and remember who I am. When I’ve had a difficult day, the rock gym is where I go to find my center. It’s where my community is, where I can focus my mind and where I feel most like me.
